This repository contains Python notebooks I created while taking Brian Caffo's statistics courses. All course examples and exercises are in R, so this repo is useful for someone taking the courses and willing to apply the course learnings in Python. I added the links to the course material of the courses included in this repo. I encourage you to check Brian Caffo's [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BrianCaffo/playlists) and the courses provided by Johnny Hopkins University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) for more learning material on statistics and data science.

## Notes:
* The notebooks may include some extra applications that were not included in the lectures. These I found helpful for understanding the topic and getting a grasp on it.
* The notebooks do not necessarily include all examples and exercises in the lectures.
